## Hey 👋
My name is **Robin**.
I am an IT/Software developer student currently based in Norway, but looking to work abroad.

I have worked on multiple projects through my studies, but my favorite is the one I am working on through an internship this semester.
Me and my team is working on a PoC digital twin of a farm, using different tools for photogrammetry, 3D modeling and analysis for further development.
Some of the software we're using for this is Reality capture, Unity, Blender, SAM 3D...

Other projects I have been a part of:
- Creating  and/or redesigning websites for smaller businesses. 
- Creating a .NET Webapplication for reporting and processing map changes.
- Creating an simple AI chatbot for giving movie recommendations based on user preferences.
